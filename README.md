# AtliQ-Grands-Hospitality-Domain-PowerBI-Project-
## 1.Project Scope:
o	Created a comprehensive data analysis project in the hospitality domain using Power BI, focusing on key performance metrics such as revenue, occupancy rates, and customer behavior.

## 2.Key Metrics Analyzed:
o	Revenue Analysis: Calculated total revenue, ADR (Average Daily Rate), and RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room).
o	Occupancy Metrics: Analyzed occupancy percentages, successful bookings, and cancellations.
o	Customer Behavior: Evaluated booking patterns, no-show rates, and realization percentages.
o	Trend Analysis: Performed week-over-week (WoW) change analysis for metrics like revenue, occupancy, ADR, and RevPAR.

## 3.	Technical Skills Demonstrated:
o	DAX Formulas: Created complex measures (e.g., WoW change %, Realisation %, Booking % by Platform).
o	Data Modeling: Worked with multiple tables (fact_bookings, dim_date, dim_rooms) and established relationships.
o	Visualization: Designed interactive dashboards to present insights clearly.

## 4.	Business Impact and Insights:
o	Provided actionable insights to optimize room pricing, improve occupancy rates, and reduce cancellations.
o	Enabled data-driven decision-making for stakeholders in the hospitality sector.

This project was a fantastic opportunity to apply my data analysis and Power BI skills to solve real-world challenges in hospitality domain.
